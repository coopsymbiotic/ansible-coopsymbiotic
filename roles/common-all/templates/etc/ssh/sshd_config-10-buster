# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with
# some PAM modules and threads)
# Symbiotic: we use this to allow Yubikey authentication, combined with password.
# Otherwise we only support pubkey-based authentication.
# Todo: have a setting to enable Yubikey only on certain hosts, and otherwise disable pubkey completely.
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.
UsePAM yes
